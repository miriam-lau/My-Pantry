# Future Implementations

## Create and Upload Recipes
Users will be able to upload and create Recipes.

## Generate Grocery Lists From Recipes
Users will be able to auto-generate grocery lists from recipes. The list
will cross-check user's pantry and generate a grocery list of the
missing ingredients.

## Auto-Import Ingredients from Recipe Websites
Users can import recipes from recipe websites, and myPantry will
auto-populate the ingredients for that recipe.
